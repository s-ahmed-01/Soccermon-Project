# Soccermon Project
 This project will involve the ingesting of a large data source pertaining to two women's teams across 2 seasons and will cover an array of topics such as injury detection/prevention and performance. At this time it uses one sample parquet file but at a later point I will be looking to scale this up to use all available data.
